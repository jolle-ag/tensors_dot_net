# The Very Basics of Tensor Networks

I followed the tutorials in [tensors.net](https://www.tensors.net/tutorials) to learn the basic methods to implement tensor networks numerically. There is one jupyter notebook per tutorial, which I used as a tool to both taking notes and solving the problems that were proposed in the tutorials. The figures are not mine and are taken from the main source.
